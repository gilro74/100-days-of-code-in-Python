Objectives
- Data Types
- Numbers
- Operations
- Type Conversions
- f-Strings

What I have learned:
-The importance of type conversions and working with same data types
-float works with decimal Numbers
-int - integers
-bolean - True or false
-string- a set of characters
-'type()' helps us determine the data type of an object.
-Type Conversions- converting data into different data types using special functions
-ValueError- it normally happens when you maybe add trying to turn the string 'abc' into an integer,
for which it is not possible.
- when you divide something in python, python automatically the solution to float.
- You can use this divide '//' if you only want the int and not the float, but be careful since its 
does necessarily round up, it just takes the integer.
- Mathematical Operations follows PEDMAS rule, P- Parenthesis, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, 
Subtraction.
-PEDMAS - goes from left to right.
-Flooring a number removes decimals to the number.
- f string converts things to you to string, you can put it before "", like f"{}"
